              <h2>I'm Sherilyn Fresco</h2>  
              <p>But my friends affectionately call me Yshe.
                At 20 years old, I'm navigating the exciting journey of young adulthood.
                My birthday falls on November 13,2002, and I proudly call Malasiqui, Pangasinan,
                my hometown. I find solace and inspiration in the pages of books and the lines
                of my journal, as reading and writing are not just pastimes for me but genuine passion.
                When it comes to music, Taylo Swift's songs resonate my heart, and her storytelling
                through music never fails to captivate me. As I continue to shape my future, I hope
                to weave together my love for creativity, writing, and maybe even a little inspiration
                from Taylor, to become a successful web designer someday.
